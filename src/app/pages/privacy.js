<b>PRIVACY STATEMENT</b>

<p>

(“Business Launch Network”, “our”, “us”, “we”) has created this privacy policy in an effort to communicate our commitment to the privacy of information provided to us by our partners and their users and/or our employer customers and their employees. Given that we are entrusted with certain types of information about the users of Business Launch Network’s network of sites and services, we acknowledge that maintenance of the privacy of such information is of the highest importance to our customers and their employees.

During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name, email address and password).

<b>
Company Contact Information
</b>
<p>
When customers and prospective customers contract for Services or inquire about our Services, we ask them to provide us with company contact information, some examples of which are the company’s name, address, number of employees, etc. We use company contact information to provide information to customers and prospective customers regarding our Services and to maintain a record of inquiries regarding our Services.

<b>
PROFILE

Cookies
</b>
<p>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. Cookies are a way to have the Internet browser remember specific bits of information allowing you to get around the site easier.
</p>
<p>
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.
</p>
<p>
By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
</p>
<b>
Log Files

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We use a tracking utility called Google Analytics that uses log files to analyze user movement.
</p>
<b>
SHARING: LEGAL DISCLAIMER
</b>
<p>
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.
</p>
<b>

<p>
We partner with other third parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these particular services, we share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.
